# coding-projects
This repository gathers the weekly projects I have done during the Bootcamp in Data Analytics. It includes python, Pandas, SQL, Tableau etc

   **Project 1 : Python**
   Python script to code an adventure game to play in the terminal.
   
  **Project 2 : Pandas**
   The project uses pandas and jupyter notebook to analyse the data of the Babynames in the US (1880 - 2021). In particular I analysed the impact of the movie Titanic on the newborns named 'Jack' and 'Rose'. The pandas library Matplotlib was used to visualize the results. 
   
   **Project 3 : Visual Data Analysis**
   The project analyses the CSV files regarding fertility rate, population and life expectancy in the world. After merging the csv in one file, I used Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyse fertility rate in Italy, Germany and Spain.
   The results show that Fer (Fertility Rate) dropped for all countries around the years when contraception pill was legalised. However, according to socio-political reasons, the paths of these countries are slightly different.
   
   (I also used Imageio to create a gif of the scatter plot during the years) 
   
   **Project 4 : SQL**
   File of queries in SQL to analyse the database of movies including the following tables (movies, ratings, tags, genre, links). 
   A 'bug' was noticed: when connecting the table of ratings and tags, if one movie has more than 1 tag, in the rating table the same movie and the same rating is repeated for every tag. As a consequence the the number of ratings for each movie is not trustwhorthy when joined with the tags table. 
   
 **Project 5: Coding Challenge**
 Sales and competitor analysis based on a real interview coding challenge - Using sales data to find business development opportunities.
